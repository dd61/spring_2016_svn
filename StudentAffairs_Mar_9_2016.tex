\section{McGhee Community Building Event}
\subsection{Feedback from the SPS Undergraduate Student Council (Chris)}
\begin{subitems}
	\item Chris and Reed attended the last meeting of the Council, and presented a draft of a needs-assessment survey based on the Committee discussion at the Feb. 26 meeting.
	\item The form was open ended, so students could add  items.
	\item Since the form is a needs-assessment survey, it contained a list of existing resources and asked students to rate (on separate scales) both their level of familiarity with each resource and how important each resource was to them.
