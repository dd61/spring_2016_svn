\section{McGhee Community Building Event}
\subsection{Feedback from the Office of Student Life (Reed and Chris)}
\begin{subitems}
	\item A needs assessment would be very valuable.
	\item A town hall (open to all student and faculty) may have low attendance and may not provide feedback that is focused enough to be implementable.
	\end{subitems}
\subsection{New Proposed Structure} 
\begin{subsubitems}
\item A survey open to all McGhee students, followed by 
\item A focus group with McGhee club officers.
\end{subsubitems}
\subsubsection{The Survey}
The survey should be (1) focused on students' clubs and (2) result-oriented. 
\subsubsection{Questions}
\begin{subsubitems}
\item Demographics (What is your class standing? How many hours a week do you work?)
\item Club participation (Are you member of a club?  Have you attended a meeting? What are the biggest hurdles to club participation? Are concentration-specific clubs too narrow?)
\item What type of events would you like clubs to offer? (For example, meeting with alumni in your concentration.) 
\end{subsubitems} 
\subsubsection{Timeline and logistics}
\begin{subsubitems}
\item Prepare a draft of the questions and present it at the next Student Council meeting.
\item Finalize the survey questions.
\item Decide when the survey should open. The Student Experience Survey is open for a while until the middle of April: can our survey be administered at the same time?
\item Decide how to distribute the survey. For example, can we ask the faculty to post a link to the survey on their NYUClasses course site?
\end{subsubitems} 
\section{Enhanced engagement in online pedagogy}

The Committee agreed to postpone the discussion after the SPS pedagogical conference \emph{Preparing Students for Successful Careers: Incorporating Rigorous Assessment and Integrating Writing in Degree Programs at SPS} on March 4th. CAES has offered a webinar on online pedagogy (\emph{CAES Educational Roundtable: Teaching in the Online Space,} 2/24/2016.) Mechthild has attended the webinar and will request the link to CAES.

\section{Student Experience Survey}
Teresa reported that the survey has been finalized and the McGhee-specific questions have not changed.
