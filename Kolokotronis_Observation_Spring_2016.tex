{\large Recomendations}

Dr.~Kolokotronis has reached out to me during the semester regarding student participation in the forum, because he had observed that some students were very late in posting to the forums (some of them even posted the week after the comments were due.) I suggested him to remind the students about the grading policies (no credit for late posts). Additional recommendations are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Require the students to give their initial response to a question by (for example) Thursday, and give substantive feedback to two other students' forum posts by (for example) Sunday.
	\item In the syllabus folder, post an example of a response to a question, and an example of substantive feedback.
	\item Create a grading rubric for forum posts.
	\item Have more online quizzes, as a preparation for the exams. 
	\item Attend a webinar on online pedagogy offered by the SPS Center for Academic Excellence and Support (CAES, \url{https://wp.nyu.edu/spscaes/events/})
